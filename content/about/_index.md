My name is David Rodriguez, and I'm a senior developer focused in projects based on Drupal, technology with which I linked almost ten years ago. I like the collaborative culture of the Open Source Software and its philosophy, and I'm a Linux user (Debian / Ubuntu mainly).

My career has been closely related to the development of projects for different public administrations (local, regional, national and international). I have made with Drupal corporate websites, internal management tools, intranets and various communication channels for contact between governments and the people.

In this website, which I have titled as one of my favorite Jazz songs, you can find content related to Drupal. I hope you find it useful.
