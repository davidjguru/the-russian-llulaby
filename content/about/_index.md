My name is David Rodriguez, and I'm a senior developer focused in projects based on Drupal, technology which I linked almost ten years ago. I like the collaborative culture of the Open Source Software and its philosophy, and I'm a Linux user (Debian / Ubuntu mainly). 
I'm and Open Source software contributor (see my Drupal.org profile [drupal.org/u/davidjguru](https://www.drupal.org/u/davidjguru)), Drupal developer and Drupal trainer/speaker. Here in my speakerdeck profile you can see some slides from sessions related with Drupal (many of these in Spanish): [speakerdeck.com/davidjguru](https://speakerdeck.com/davidjguru). I usually give talks, sessions and workshops periodically.   

My career has been closely related to the development of projects for different public administrations (local, regional, national and international). I have made with Drupal corporate websites, internal management tools, intranets and various communication channels for contact between governments and the people. You can see some references in my Linkedin profile: [linkedin.com/in/davidjguru/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjguru/).  

In this website, which I have titled as one of my favorite Jazz songs, you can find content related to Drupal. You can read more content written by me on other sites, like:
 
 * My little personal board for Drupal tips: [davidjguru.githug.io](https://davidjguru.github.io/)  
 * My collection of day-to-day snippets on Gitlab: [gitlab.com/davidjguru/snippets](https://gitlab.com/users/davidjguru/snippets)  
 * My profile in Dev.to: [dev.to/davidjguru](https://dev.to/davidjguru)  
 
I hope you find it useful.
