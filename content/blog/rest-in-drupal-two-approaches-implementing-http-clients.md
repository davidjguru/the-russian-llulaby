Imagine that you have to integrate JavaScript code into your Drupal project... Where do you start? How do you do it? You're looking for information but you don't find anything "holistic", something that goes from 0 to 100 and that puts in context how the relationships between Drupal and JavaScript are structured. Well, this article was made for you (Or for other people in your team that you want to introduce to this topic).

In this guide you will learn basic concepts of JavaScript, the terminology used in Drupal, functions, methods and common mechanics to enrich your projects by make them run with executable code on the client side. And all through a combination of theory and practice. It includes some exercises that I have integrated.
