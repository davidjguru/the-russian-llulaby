It is said that a small change or the sum of many of them can end up generating great transformations. This is valid as a legend to address improvements or to analyze the meaning of chaos, but now I just want to use it to frame the meaning of today's article. Well, I was speaking about perfomance with some of my colleagues and then I thought of some cases from diverse projects I had worked on and decided to put together some notes about perfomance always in a PHP / Drupal. I have gathered various experiences, conclusions and notes and tried to articulate them in an orderly way. You might be interested if you are concerned about the slowness of your Drupal installation. One part to find out how some issues work at the performance level, other parts to improve it, so yes...today I'll write about this topic. There we go!

## Introduction

Managing Performance and the related improvements is a complex and arduos process consisting of a multitude of records, testing and interventions, in a continuous cycle of test-measure-review-intervention, and this can be quite a tedious task. Due to this, therefore, in order to better define the baselines, I'll describe the intervention escenarios as layers within the tech stack of our project, in order to address increasingly specific tasks and technological differences based on their own context.  

Maybe for some people the scope of this post will be advanced, for others it will be very basic...in my defense, I can only say that I have over a hundred pages in various documents that I have been writing down, and that I would like to put in the form of articles. As always, I would like these publications to be of interest to someone in the same situation. This is just the first one (I guess). In any case, be patient and enjoy.  


### Acknowledgements & Reading Materials

The first assumption that we must make is that we have a long, complex and abstract path ahead of us, so to conjure up these challenges we will take as a premise the idea that _**"Knowing where to start and which issues are of high priority can be one of the most difficult parts of optimizing a site"**_ , one of the first (and main idea) present in the fundamental work _**"High Performance Drupal"(2013)**_ , written by Sheltren, Newton and Catchpole: [oreilly.com/high-performance-drupal](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-drupal/9781449358013/) and which has turned out to be an old basic pillar of our training as part of the Drupal community.  

This journey will take place together with them and always with a hand on their essential work about performance issues in the context of Drupal-based projects. Only if we stading on the shoulders of giants can we better see the horizon. Don't you think so?.  

This whole process of experience and iterative learning, has been produced - _in my case, at least_ - progressively through practice and theory. In addition to a set of links that I am incorporating in the final section [-here-](#step-6---read-more-and-more-and-more), I recommend as study material the following related books: 

* PHP 7 Data Structures and Algorithms - Mizanur Rahman (2018), [published by Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/php-7-data-structures-and-algorithms/9781786463890).
* High Performance Drupal - Jeff Sheltren, Narayan Newton, Nathaniel Catchpole (2013), [published by O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-drupal/9781449358013/).
* Drupal 9 Module Development - Daniel Sipos (2020), [published by Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/drupal-9-module-development-third-edition/9781800204621). Was already [reviewed here in this article](https://www.therussianlullaby.com/blog/books-drupal-module-development/).  


### The Heuristic Approach 

Heuristics as we know it today - but also as we intuit it - remains a combined issue of divergent thinking and creative tensions, a result of which these two keys to try to find concrete solutions to specific problems are intertwined by treating these two lines as true tools of reasoned thought or at least as resources for rational mechanisms of analysis.  

Basically we could interpret it as a discipline of human rational activity that can have two meanings: on the one hand, it can be a method of enquiry based on experience to understand specific problems.  On the other hand, it can be something more related to arts, tactics and strategies, ready to be oriented to the generation of particular solutions. The first meaning would be more linked to the Hungarian mathematician [Imre Lakatos (1983)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos). The second one can be directly related to another illustrious Hungarian mathematician called [George P贸lya (1945)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya), so if we assume that a child can owe his upbringing to two people of the same sex, we would have to converge assuming that Heuristics as a small paradigm has two parents called P贸lya and Lakatos.  

The case of P贸lya is important in this case, since with his seminal work _**["How to solve it"](https://www.amazon.es/How-Solve-Mathematical-Penguin-Science/dp/0140124993)**_ he lays the foundations of this type of lateralized approaches to consistent problems, providing us besides a strong conceptual framework, with an elementary process to approach our works under this prism:  

* **Polya's First Principle:** Understanding the problem.
* **Polya's Second Principle:** Create a plan.
* **Polya's Third Principle:** Carry out the plan.
* **Polya's Fourth Principle:** Look back, Review and interpret the result.

**Read more about the four principles of P贸lya**: [math.berkeley/polya.pdf](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf).  

As with any major problem that remains (for the moment) in the form of the enormous and the abstract, our situation invites a lateral approach, intuitive interpretation, thoughtful creativity: we have some macro figures, some "general" assessments regarding the performance of our Drupal installation and we must reduce it: that is our mission, the only important thing now, Mr Anderson. 

But as it's still an undetermined scenario (thinking about the first time), I require and propose a lateral, partial, iterative and incremental approach. We need perhaps to induce more than to deduct and take the parts until we reach the category and settle the whole. For all these reasons, we have chosen a heuristic approach that allows us to work with items, activities and strategies that facilitate the lateral approach of that great vessel that is itself the performance of an online platform of these characteristics.  

**How do I prepare my little heuristic?** My approach is based on the gathering of a series of fundamental items from which to establish the basic framework: we will resort to the great sources of each technology to study, collect and evaluate the configuration proposals they offer, to accumulate possible actions that will give rise to an initial study checklist that we can compare and check in parallel if the interventions generate fruits in the form of measurable changes. I build checklists, execute interventions, obtain values and compare results.  
 
We will then operate on that base framework by extending reviews of more advanced issues.  



### Scenario   

Now I would like to share what is my current stack, just in the moment while I'm writing these lines. Actually the experiences gathered here come from different scenarios, for several different projects and clients, so as part of the objectives of this article I wanted to unify everything in a single scenario. 

**Why?** Well, while I was reviewing and checking all the tests and values, I remembered that many were also conducted in different environments: from local development to production (live)...so to move forward I have unified everything in a environment ready for testing.  

This test environment does not really represent other scenarios with much fidelity: DDEV is not its "live" version but its DDEV-Local version, or it does not contain orchestration tools such as Kubernetes (required in almost any deployment), or management from OpenShift. However, it's a stack that anyone can reproduce on their computer with very basic tools and does not require hard learning or installation, configuration, deployment or scaling processes. That's why I think it's a good idea to keep it simplified for the purposes of this article.  

So my current environment is build so:

## Step 1 - Select your Tooling

The first step in our way is oriented to looking for and select a set of tools to be used in our scenarios. I've gathered some of the most recurrent resources.  


### Prompt 

#### Apache Benchmarking 

```bash
sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

#### Parallel

```bash
sudo apt install parallel
```

#### GNU-Plot

```bash
sudo apt install gnu-plot
```

#### Others

**TMUX** 

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

**Atop**

```bash
sudo apt install atop
```


**Siege**

```bash
sudo apt install siege
```

```bash
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt install apache2-utils \
parallel \
gnu-plot \ 
tmux \
atop \
siege
```

Or you can download from this repository and execute it just like a bash script for Ubuntu / Debian:  

```bash
$ wget https://gitlab.com/davidjguru/scripting_for_drupal/-/raw/main/clinic/installing_tooling_for_performance
$ chmod +x installing_tooling_for_performance
$ ./installing_tooling_for_performance
```
**AWARE:** Remember that the script will executes update and upgrade of your installed packages.  


### Browser Extensions

#### Diver

#### PLT

#### RTM


### Drupal Modules

#### Performance Monitor


#### Monitoring
 

#### Remote Dashboard 


## Step 2 - Take an updated photo

### Make your own plan

From the book "High Performance Drupal":  

1. Measure and record the current site performance.  
2. Define goals and requirements for the site.  
3. Actually perform your review.  
4. Define a list of potential improvements based on the site goals and requirements,
using the information gathered in the performance baseline and your review.
