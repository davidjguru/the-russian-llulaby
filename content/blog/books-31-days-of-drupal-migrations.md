Perhaps of all the Drupal available APIs, the Migrate API is one of the areas of knowledge most hidden from the average Drupal user. It's even possible that as you read this post, you know for the first time that there is a whole set of Drupal modules both in core and contributed, and fully dedicated to the design and execution of migration processes within Drupal. You can move data from an old Drupal to the most recent version but also from others databases, files, systems, frameworks, CMS, DXPs... and all these options are aggregated around the Drupal Migrate API, a set of resources that requires much time of dedication, among other things, due to the disintegration of the available information, until now. The book that I will discuss today comes to bring order and unification in all this. Pay attention.

## 1- Introduction

Migration processes are a fairly frequent issue in project development: it is quite normal to build a new Drupal-based website for a client that already has its platform implemented in a different technology (not kidding, this hapens). As part of these processes, a client or customer may need to move their data to the new platform using a new data model as Drupal does with its tables and relations.  
 
In these situations, several scenarios open up for these processes: the study of the origin of the data, the processing possibilities, the methodology to sanitize the information and how to store it in a stable way in our new environment. What I have just briefly described is what is involved in [an ETL process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load): Extraction - Transformation and Load for the data migration, and this is the spirit of the book I am discussing today: the exhaustive study of the design and execution for ETL process in Drupal.  

## 2- The Book

It's difficult for me to evaluate this book as it deserves. So I guess maybe the first thing I want to say is that I think this is the first time I'm faced with such an integrated and compact body of knowledge/experience. 





## 3- Recommendations

Actually, I guess I could say - in a nutshell - that any work team implementing Drupal-based projects should have a copy of this book available. And I wouldn't be exaggerating, I swear. I think this huge, extensive and thorough work compiled by Mauricio Dinarte has too much importance and it's quite interesting too. This can't to go unnoticed.  

On the other hand, being "Migrations" a topic that actually encompasses and relates to other Drupal APIs, it can also provide quite a lot of knowledge to people in a technical team who want to learn more about Drupal internals: Plugins, Services, Entities, Drush, Debugging...these are cross-cuttings topics in this book and they are also very important issues. Maybe you wanna learn more about  that.
