Perhaps of all the Drupal available APIs, the Migrate API is one of the areas of knowledge most hidden from the average Drupal user. It's even possible that as you read this post, you know for the first time that there is a whole set of Drupal modules both in core and contributed, and fully dedicated to the design and execution of migration processes within Drupal. You can move data from an old Drupal to the most recent version but also from others databases, files, systems, frameworks, CMS, DXPs... and all these options are aggregated around the Drupal Migrate API, a set of resources that requires much time of dedication, among other things, due to the disintegration of the available information, until now. The book that I will discuss today comes to bring order and unification in all this. Pay attention.

## 1- Introduction


 



## 2- The Book

![Cover of 31 Days of Drupal Migrations, by Mauricio Dinarte](../../images/post/davidjguru_drupal_8_9_books_31_days_of_drupal_migrations_one.png)


It's difficult for me to evaluate this book as it deserves. So I guess maybe the first thing I want to say is that I think this is the first time I'm faced with such an integrated and compact body of knowledge/experience. 





## 3- Recommendations

Actually, I guess I could say - in a nutshell - that any work team implementing Drupal-based projects should have a copy of this book available. And I wouldn't be exaggerating, I swear. I think this huge, extensive and thorough work compiled by Mauricio Dinarte has too much importance and it's quite interesting too. This can't to go unnoticed.
